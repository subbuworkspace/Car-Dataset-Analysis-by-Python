# Car-Dataset-Analysis-by-Python

This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a car dataset using Python. The process includes handling missing values, removing nulls, and preparing the data for meaningful insights. After cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to uncover trends and patterns in the dataset.

Features
	•	Data Cleaning: Handling missing/null values, duplicates, and inconsistencies
	•	Data Transformation: Structuring and preparing the dataset for analysis
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends, distributions, and key insights

Technologies Used
	•	Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
	•	Jupyter Notebook

Usage

Clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the notebook to explore the cleaned data and insights.
